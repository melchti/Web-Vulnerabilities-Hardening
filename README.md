# Web-Vulnerabilities-Hardening

The Scenario for this assignment was as follows:

In this assignment, you will test three web application vulnerabilities. For each vulnerability you will be provided with the following:

•	Steps detailing how to setup and access the application.

•	A walkthrough explaining how the application is intended to work.

•	A task that will test the application for vulnerabilities.

Your goal is to determine if the application is vulnerable and provide mitigations.


In this homework scenario, you will continue as an application security engineer at Replicants. Replicants created several new web applications and would like you to continue testing them for vulnerabilities. Additionally, your manager would like you to research and test a security tool called BeEF in order to understand the impact it could have on the organization if Replicants was targeted with this tool.
